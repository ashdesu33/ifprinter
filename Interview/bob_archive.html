            I'm Bob Nangle. So I'm one of the owners of Meridian Printing. We're a commercial printing company that specializes in sheet fed offset print. As for my personal background, I'm a Rhode Island person who grew up here, went to University of Rhode Island for college. My degree is more in finance and accounting. Out of school, I went to work for a printing company in Connecticut and they were doing what's called business forms. So it would be 3 pot forms, computer paper with the pin holes along the side, carbon paper that used to be, (well before your time) before carbonless paper. I was in that printing industry for a few years, and then I moved back to Rhode Island and eventually ended up coming to work here in Meridian Printing.

            Over time I evolved from being in the accounting side to being in the operation side. Then in 2002, myself and my business partner, we bought the company. We've owned it for the last 22 years.

            Inevitably, 90% of kids who go to college don't end up in the field that they think they're going to end up in. So you have graphic design today, you could be a bus driver tomorrow. You evolve into something, fall into something. So a lot of people just evolve, and will fall into something. So because my degree was accounting, moving right out of school, I went to work as a staff accountant at a printing company in Connecticut.

            I was transferring from Connecticut to Missouri. So being with the big company, that's what happens. You're there for two years and they transferred me to Southeast Missouri into a different plant. So they had 13 printing companies throughout the US. So I went from Connecticut, to Kennett Missouri and I was there for a year and a half. And then I didn't like living in the mid-south. We talked about this for an hour, but I ended up meeting my wife down there. Moved back to Rhode Island, went into the food industry for a number of years. A coffee company.

            When we first started here, an Irish company had just bought the company. They owned Meridian back in 1997. So I helped them run the company, helped them buy other printing companies, and then they ended up wanting to sell some of the other printing companies. So we worked on selling those printing companies. And then we bought Meridian. So that's how I went from University of Rhode Island, Connecticut, Missouri and back to Rhode Island.

            Those are called tuck-ins. So we've bought a couple of the smaller companies in Rhode Island. So you look at them and say they have $1,000,000 of sales, how do we get that $1,000,000 to transfer over to our company? What assets do we need to accommodate that and all the times you can do with the current hard assets that you have, but more importantly, what people do you need that you can bring over. So part of an acquisition is not just to take the sales, but possibly some of the working assets and some of the employees. So that's gonna help strengthen your company. And so the goal is can you move all of those sales over and successfully hold on to all of those sales over that following 1,3,5,10 year period.

            But what's changed a lot in the printing industry is sales are getting more and more difficult to have. So at some point, you may have me talk about this, but people are doing less and less printing. Therefore we have to figure out ways. How do we keep our machines busy?

      The offset printing has not changed a lot from the technology standpoint. Offset printing 25 years ago versus today is similar, but the electronic side of offset printing is much better. So now you can look at a computer screen and you see the different color plateds. The speed of the presses is much greater. The registration of those presses today are greater than they were 25 years ago.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      <span>
      You get all of those better things. So what used to be 3000 impressions an hour. We're now running  12, 16,000 impressions an hour, so we're 2,3,4,5 times faster than running. We used to take an hour or an hour and a half to made-ready. It's now taking 15 minutes to 1/2 hour. We used to take a long time to make a printing plate,it’s now way down. So the older technology 25 years ago was you were working with line type, and so you were working with lead.  You work in that setting type. You were working with film. The old film technology is you can actually do table stripping. You burn the films, cutting pieces of films, putting together a whole plate based on those pieces of film, and then you're going to burn that film image onto that plate, but it took weeks of Pre-Press to get to that point. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      <span>
        So you, the designer, took weeks of setting the files up versus today. You're doing everything in Indesign and sending us an electronic file, so it used to be the Pre-Press side of things used to take multiple weeks, weeks and then printing today. Today, the prepress side of it is a day. You can get a file today and you would be able to proof today. So we are able to turn a proof around very quickly today versus we used to have the output film then we have to go from film to burn it on plates and then we have a plate ready to go for the printing press.

     We had a standalone pre-press company in Providence. So we imprint and owned Elite Color Group. So back in the 70s and 80s, color houses were all over the place doing all kinds of different color work for different industries and the printing industry being one of those. And so they were actually stripping film in those locations and getting it ready to make plates for printing companies. So they had multiple employees that were getting in files. They would actually take images of those files to make printed film and then strip that film to burn them. So it was very labor intensive and very, very time consuming.

     Then electronically, a device called Scitex came out. It basically is Photoshop on steroids. So it came out to where you can actually take both a horse's head, cut it, and paste it onto another horse's head. Now you're doing some early days of Photoshop.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     We were able to build that Scitex out at like $750 an hour. So if you had things that you needed me to cut and paste that electronically onto something else, we would charge you $750 per hour to do it, and it would literally take an hour for somebody to cut the head off, move it over to this horse, put it on, plug it in.

   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     Yes, so it was the very beginning stages of Photoshop and therefore it was very talented people who were doing this and therefore you could charge that kind of money. So the designer still designed everything, and the color house technician copied those layout from the designer. And then they type whatever the font was that that that designer designed the job in, then they would typeset using that font on a typeset machine to get it all things in there. But even before the typeset machine, you had lead type. So it would be the lead type that was being set on trays.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     Today that's done in seconds with AI. It's done by itself to some level and you can't charge $750,000 because it took you 7 seconds or 3 minutes to do it. So that was one of the beginnings of how the prepress became more electronic versus analog. In addition to the Scitex happening, you now could digitally burn a plate while on the old system you would expose that film to light and burn. What used to take hours and hours to make a cyan, magenta, yellow, and key plate is now taking minutes on the automated plate status, and that was what was happening in the early 80s, mid 80s, and late 80s.

     Technology kept getting better. It kept getting better and kept getting better. So as soon as you brought one device, a year later that was obsolete. As soon as you brought your first computer that became obsolete; as soon as you bought your first Mac that became obsolete. And so the technology kept going and it changed slowly at the beginning, it picked up speed and it still continues to change daily now, not everybody keeps up with all of that technology.

    What we have to do is we have to make sure we have enough of the old platforms to work with everybody. So if you're still on Quark, which nobody's still on Quark. But if someone had a Quark file, we probably still have Quark on one of the old computers back there that we could open that up and try to convert over to InDesign.

   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     Or if you have an InDesign x that's way back, we may still have that InDesign x that we can open up that file and move it forward to a newer one.  More and more designers are keeping up with technology in the present than before. If you're on InDesign, you probably have a web license, and then automatically it's gonna update. So you can't stay old. You have to stay current.

     Let's just take paper for example. 30 years ago, there were hundreds of papers around, so you could get very high quality. You can get very low.  So they graded paper as a #1 sheet, a #2 sheet, a #3 sheets and the #1 sheet was very good paper. However, they had certain tolerance levels that they had to work with. So they would meet certain tolerance levels. Then we would make sure when that paper came in that it met our standards of that tolerance level. Is it the right weight that we want? Is it the right shade? So those are all things that we would visually look at. If we get a piece of paper on press and it's not holding the ink or it's crumbling or the coating is falling off, we then would reject that paper. So if it's not meeting our quality standards, we then have to make a decision. Are we gonna keep this paper or reject the paper? If that vendor cannot get us replacement paper or that vendor continues to give us bad products, we're not gonna continue to work with that vendor. A good shop is gonna make sure that we're only as good as our suppliers are, and that suppliers are only as good as their suppliers are. At the end of the day, I can't come to you and say I can't print your yearbook this year because the paper guy didn't do this.

     There were a lot of changes in management styles and management philosophies over the last thirty years. So earlier there were management gurus out there that were talking about how to become a better company, how to get better controls in place, how to get better quality. And one of the quality things back in the day was you would always have someone on the floor doing quality control. One person would be pulling things off, inspecting it, and put them in this pile and put them in this pile. Put them in this pile and put them in this pile.

     And then somebody says, why are there bad pieces? And then you stop and think about it. Well, why? Why can you do it right here, but you can't do it right here? Then they started going back and looking at the process.

     Why you, the operator, why can't you do better than that? And then they started training the operators again. So you were producing 1% waste. You were producing 7% waste. The company had a tolerance level of 10% waste. Why does it have to be 10%? Can it be 9%? Can it be 8%? Can it be 7%? Can it be 0%? And so that became a management style, a management philosophy still to this day, my expectation is zero defects. That's my expectation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     If you don't have that as an expectation, then you're already falling short. If you say all we have to do is get close enough, then you've fallen short.  People say, well, it's close enough. That's fine. You're going for brain surgery. I'm gonna get you a doctor that's gonna be close enough, and you're okay with that. Right? You know, you're booking a flight tomorrow. I'm gonna get you on a plane that you'll get there close enough. Don't worry about it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     No.I wanna make sure I'm gonna get there. So the mindset has to be, I want it to be perfect, because if you go into something already thinking, I'm gonna go to work today, and I'm only gonna produce 90% good stuff. You say to the kids and they say, see, dad, go produce 90% good stuff, 10% shit. That's how management evolved over time, and how companies became more strengthened in all of the manufacturing process to get it better and better and better. So having good suppliers, good equipment, and good employees is what makes manufacturing companies good, and you can't be good without all three of those working.

Then another printer came along to a client one day and said, but we can get you that same job. We can put you on a pretty good paper. It's not the same, but we can save you a hundred dollars. And a client said, great. Save money on one job. We talked about the paper quality, but you know what? That doesn't matter. It's fine. Next thing you know, they got them.

They have to start making cheaper paper, and cheaper paper, and cheaper paper. And so it's driven the price down. It's driven the price down. It's driven the price down. Thirty years ago, you bought a refrigerator. It lasted you thirty years. Today, you buy a refrigerator, it lasts you three or five years. We already have a planned disposal. Things built today don't last, so it keeps the market going to get another piece. Printing is one of those things.

Instead of printing at 2,000 sheets an hour, I need to print 15,000 sheets an hour. So I gotta buy a press that can get me faster. You're gonna get employees to step up and make sure that they're running those presses at that speed level. It is becoming more and more demanding on manufacturers to get better controls in place to be able to squeeze out the lowest cost they can to be successful enough to stay in business.

     It continues that way, and we as consumers all sometimes buy a price and sometimes buy a quality. Everything you buy, sometimes it's because it's the best price. Sometimes it's like, I hate that yogurt, I don't care that it's 10¢. I need to pay a dollar for the yogurt because this is much better. That's something that you really like and that you really wanna be. So you'll set a price limit for what you're gonna spend. But there's different qualities in everything that's manufactured.

     This is part of the change that we're talking about. We looked at GHP; GHP in West Haven, Connecticut is a a printing company that's about four times the size of us. So we're the owners of the company in the last twenty years. When we bought the business, we bought brand new equipment. We took money from the bank. We took debt. We bought equipment. Seven years go by. We buy newer equipment, trade that in, buy new equipment, take it down from the bank.

     Our employees who started here thirty five years ago when they were 30 years old and now sixty five years old. So we have employees that 90% of our workforce is 60 years and older which means they're gonna retire this week, this year, next year, five years.

     We have 40 employees, and we lose 10 over the next five years. How are we gonna replace them? They call you. You're young. You wanna run a print. How do we find someone young who wants to come in and run a print. It's harder and harder to do.

   <p class="answer">

     My digital press is a 12 inch by 18 inch. When I quoted the yearbook four years ago, five years ago, two years ago, we were getting four page out. Two pages, two pages. So it was a four pager that we were getting out. Last year, you moved it based on price to a press, who has a wider format digital press. They're getting 20 pages or 10 pages or 12 pages out on a sheet versus my four pages.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     There's a click charge that's associated with digital printing. It's like a copy machine. You pay 10¢ a copy. You pay 10¢ a click. If they're paying 10¢ and they get a sheet this big and I'm paying 10¢ and I'm getting a sheet this big Mhmm. My cost on my digital press is gonna be greater than their cost.  If it was 50 postcards, I'm in the ballpark. But say yours is a 500 page book, that's a lot of forms that has to go on. So this year, we quoted it on the wider press at GHP, and we're able to get 30% off on our pricing to get it into this right range to where we could keep the job.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     And so why did we do this? Because we weren't ready to put more money into more equipment. We weren't ready to buy wider format digital presses. So the digital press could be a million dollars, could be $2,000,000. They already had all of the digital equipment, a lot of the digital equipment. Their offset presses were not as good as our offset presses. We thought this merge, which basically what we're doing, merging with them, our offset presses with their digital is gonna make one big better company.

We're gonna have less production. The employee's gonna retire, and we're not gonna have people here. We can't replace them. So doing nothing wasn't a solution.

     It becomes an expectation, but it's not an achievable expectation for a lot of people. So getting younger people that come into manufacturing, as I said earlier, is not an easy thing to know. Hiring more people's not been easy. Investing more in equipment has not been easy.

   <p class="answer">

     Rhode Island jumps through hoops to keep Hasbro. They'll give Hasbro whatever they want to keep them in in Rhode Island. I tell them I'm gonna move out of state, and they're gonna say, that's too bad. So you can't just do it because Hasbro is Hasbro and they're big. You gotta look at all your forty, fifty, a hundred employee shops and figure out how are you gonna help left to.

   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     To be honest with you, we're not looking for help. Businesses say, oh, just leave us alone. Just don't keep changing the rules. But every year, they keep introducing new bills. Half of them don't go anywhere, but they keep introducing them again and again and again. And over time, another one gets implemented. Another one gets implemented. Another one gets implemented. And it just erodes at the companies that are trying to keep up with all of those rules. So the decision was do nothing was not a good decision.

     I would say every time we signed a new bank deal with the bank again. Yes. You get a new bank. I won't do it for another couple of years.

     I mean, for now, every time we reinvested in the business and reinvestment, it could have been new equipment. Those are all I mean, it's like everything in life. You have days that are highs and days that are lows. Having risk with the banks in the low, having the bank finance you some new equipment is a high. And so banks love you till they don't love you. If you're making a lot of money, they love you. They wanna lend you more money because you're making a lot of money.  You're not making any money and you need money, they don't wanna lend you.

     I think it would be some of the old letter presses that were out there in the typesetting. We had that when we bought sign out press up in Vermont, that was one of the acquisitions we've done when we were owned by the Irish.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     They still had letter presses. They still had lead. They still had so that technology, it would have been nice if we had kept one of those presses with all that lead. Environmentally, it's not good to have that lead because it's dangerous, but there are still letter press shops in New York and even Rhode Island have lead press shops, and they're doing it with more plastic polymer plates than the actual lead.

     But I think the older technology, the slowness of that, the pace of life would have been is what I would say I miss the most. Twenty years ago, we couldn't believe the pace we were going on. I couldn't believe this designer wants us to get this job done in six weeks. They're crazy. Today, it's six minutes we gotta get it done. So you don't know what mode you're in until you're not in that mode anymore.

     It's always easier to look back. Yesterday was the only easy day. When you hit that day yesterday, that was the worst day of your life. But today is even worse. So yesterday was the easy day.  I think we all, as human beings, always look back at how things were. Some of it is tainted. Our memory is not great as to how great it was, and wish we made it a little back there a little bit.

     You can think about even the family. You know? When I was a kid growing up, we even had our as a family. Today, I mean, I don't even know where the kids are. But that's the world.

     What kind of technology/presses would you like to have in the future?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     Digital presses. We were looking to expand in digital. So we wish we had wider format digital presses. There's always better technology than what we have.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     But wishing for something and needing it are two different things. We don't really need another offset press, but we really do need a wider format digital press. Getting something that can do a nineteen twenty five sheet versus a twelve eighteen sheet is we really need to be competitive with everybody.

     However you gotta be careful what you wish for because what you wish for might not be what you need. Grass always looks greener. So you look at other people who are driving a nicer car. Better satellite TV. Better cell phones every year. Better computers.

     I'm gonna say they probably make less money than you. There are a lot of people that live way beyond their means. It doesn't mean they're having a better life. Some point, that's gonna crash now on them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     They're living life large today, but it doesn't mean they're having a better life. So I try not to compare myself to anybody. First of all, because I really don't care. I mean, I'm not on Twitter because I don't really care what my kids did yesterday. If I care, I'm gonna pick up a phone.

     So I don't look at other things and other people they wish.  I mean, I everybody controls their own destiny. I control my own destiny. I pick and choose what I wanna do and where I wanna be. I became this person because I chose to do that, and I worked to do that, and a lot of people don't want that. That's fine. A lot of people don't wanna work at it. That's fine. So you get to be who you wanna be, how you wanna be.

     It's tough. I mean, it's tough when you're signing out, you know, because you need to make certain money. You're gonna sacrifice some of your morals to make a little bit more money, and you just gotta pick out which morals to sacrifice. You might say I'm gonna be good. I'm gonna get back to homeless people. But you can't afford to get back to homeless people. You don't make enough money yourself. Yeah. So, you know, at some point, you’ll  then need to make enough money to do that. We all look at the world differently. In different stages of our life.

     What's your favorite ways of getting informations?
    </span>

   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     So I'm good at asking stupid questions. When I get into a meeting, I get kicked a lot by people. Like, you know the answer to this. Why are you asking a question? Because I like asking the question. I like listening to the answer. As they answer in the question, it brings up another question, which brings up another question. I would like to make a decision until I understand what it is we've even talking about. So there are many times I'm in a conversation, and I'm like,  I gotta just stop. I'm not sure what we're really talking about. Can we just go back to here? Are we talking about this? Are we talking about I don't know what we're talking. Okay. Then what is it about this that went and then then I gotta understand it.
    </span>

   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     That gets back to what I said earlier about management style. It's called the root cause. What is the root cause of the error? Well, the guy over here gave me the crap and so that's all I could do.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     Okay. But he's not the root cause. So go to him. Why did you give him an inferior pen?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     Because the guy over here only gave me ink, half the ink I needed. That's not the root cause. You gotta go back in. Why do you wanna give a long story because Shrutnik goes all the way back is somebody forgot to place the order for ink.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     We gave him half as much so we can get this guy half as much. He can and so why did we not order enough ink? Well, we don't have an ordering system here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     So now we can go all the way back to here, fix the ordering system, which now gets that whole problem fixed. That's who I am in life is I try to go back and listen to people, ask questions, and understand from their perspective. People always has different perspective.  What I've learned is listen to both sides. So the first person that comes to you probably has got the wrong story because they're running too fast for some reason, but I'll still listen to them. I'll then go back to the second person and say, I understand this this issue happening. I won't say what the issue is. I understand this issue with between you and your.

     Listen to that, Chrissy. Sorry. And now I got 40 more questions in my head that I wanna go back to you. Yeah. I've been thinking about this. Tell me about that. Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you that. Well, tell me a little bit more about that. Oh, yeah. You did it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     Now after multiple conversations.  I now think I can make a decision versus you came to me and said this, I go over and I say you're fired. Why? Oh, you did that. No. I did. You're on it. Go.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="answer">
    <span>
     That happens at times. People will do that. You might do that to a friend. Your best friend comes to you and says this. I'm gonna never talk to you again. I'm like, and your best friend could have good intentions, but maybe he or she misunderstood something. And so once we mentally go down a path. it's hard for us to go back and say, yeah, I should have listened to the other side.  I made those mistakes. You you probably have, and you're probably gonna still make them. You gotta try to figure out how to prevent doing that.

     I guess something that has some longevity. If this is something that's gonna be out there, not that someone's gonna Google and say, hey, look at this interview. But this is now written down somewhere. Maybe it's a grandchild, a great grandchild, a great great grandchild, somewhere down the road through AI comes across. That was my great great great grandfather. And so I wish I knew more about my heritage. I wish I knew more about my great great great grandfather. Someday, I might look at my tree and go backwards and try to understand it, but actually having conversation with my great great great grandfather would make I really wish I could have done. Here would be my great great great grandchildren that lived in me too. This is all my way down the road. Wow. That was my great great great grandpa. So that's how I would vision this happen.
