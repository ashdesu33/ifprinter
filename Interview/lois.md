## Who is Lois?

### The Journey

#### Can you provide a little intro of who you are and what you define your profession?

My name is Lois Ada. I'm an artist and printmaker. I work at DWRI Letterpress, which is a commercial letterpress print shop located on the west side of Providence.

I've worked here for about 14 years. When I started, I was a press operator. And then I transitioned pretty quickly into sales design and client management. So my job is primarily on the computer, which is depressing.

####  So you start the relationships with the press first, and then gradually show to more like a designer role.

Exactly. So the shop is owned by Dan Wood. So the shop is called Dan Wood. Rhode Island Letter Press. It's a Donna Karen in New York. Joke, DKNY. You've seen that fashion brand. So when I started working for Danny was in a much smaller shop and it was just.

Me working part-time and Dan, so Dan did all the admin and the client management. And then we've really grown over the last 10 years now we have three employees, plus Dan. So there's a press operator named Hope who was also on the tour. And Tom, our production coordinator who was also on the tour, we took a field trip for the office.
