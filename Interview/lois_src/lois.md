## Who is Lois?

### Design & Printing!


#### Can you provide a little intro of who you are and what you define your profession?

**Image:** lois_src/edit-11.jpg

My name is Lois Harada. I'm an artist and printmaker. I work at DWRI Letterpress, which is a commercial letterpress print shop located on the west side of Providence.

I've worked here for about 14 years. When I started, I was a press operator. And then I transitioned pretty quickly into sales design and client management. So my job is primarily on the computer, which is depressing.

####  So you start the relationships with the press first, and then gradually show to more like a designer role.

Exactly. So the shop is owned by Dan Wood. So the shop is called Dan Wood. Rhode Island Letterpress. It's Donna Karen in New York. Joke, DKNY. You've seen that fashion brand. 

When I started working for Dan it was in a much smaller shop and it is now. Me working part-time and Dan, so Dan did all the admin and the client management. And then we've really grown over the last 10 years now we have three employees, plus Dan. So there's a press operator named Hope who was also on the tour. And Tom, our production coordinator who was also on the tour, took a field trip to the office.

####  What's your relationship with "printing"?

**Image:** lois_src/edit-5.jpg

 I studied printmaking at RISD, and  I graduated in 2010. So for me, print is the way that I express myself. That's the medium I always go back to. Commercial printing is more appealing to me because you can make a lot of something very quickly, whereas traditional printmaking is super precious.  For instance, I have some new prints right now. One print is $500. While a letterpress print could be free, or it could be $10, $20, $50. To me, the economy of commercial printing is appealing, and I think print is just how my brain works at this point. So I always think, okay, even if I design something or have an idea what will it look like when it's out? 

I think of design as a tool. I don't think of it as the driver of the process. So I think of the concept or the idea first, and then I use design to get to the press. So I probably don't spend as much time as I should in design, because at this point I know what's gonna work and what won't work.

## About DWRI
### Some History
#### How did DWRI start?

**Image:** lois_src/edit-3.jpg

Dan started DWRI 20 or 21 years ago.  His first introduction to commercial printing after studying traditional printmaking was offset printing. He worked at a bunch of different presses in DC, in Providence.  Actually, he worked at Meridian as a paper feeder. So his job was to put the paper into the presses.

He started to transition to letterpress printing, took some jobs for friends like bar and marriage invitations, and then it gradually grew into the Press as we know it now. It becomes a commercial entity.

#### What is the workflow for the current press?

So ideally the files are set up in a way that we can use, but. That happens rarely. So we'll spend a lot of time going back and forth. We keep getting files from Canva now, which makes us jump off of a building.

So we figured out a few workarounds for Canva, but it's not it's not an ideal process. Yeah. And we're trying really hard just to say the client's at the file's, versus oh, this does not look good because it's just from Canva and it's somebody setting type who just doesn't have any experience setting type.

### The Letterpress vs The Digital World
#### Why do you think people choose letterpress instead of digital prints? 
**Image:** lois_src/edit-13.jpg

Part of the charm of letterpress printing is that everything is essentially a mechanized form of relief printing. So you can feel the surface of the sheet. You can feel that print. Something is actually pushed into the surface of the sheet, meaning I can also use super thick papers that you can't run through a digital printer. 

The other thing is that it's a really accurate color process. If you give me these three spot colors, I can nail those pretty consistently. It is handmade, and it's more of a bespoke process.

#### Yes I do notice a lot of DWRI clients are using letterpress for important personal events too, and I assume the physical touch gives that intimacy.

Yes, but sometimes we will swap in digital printing for some elements due to the budget limits, and honestly, digital printing has gotten a lot better in the last couple years. Sometimes we collaborate with other presses. For instance, we work with a women owned shop in Massachusetts that has an indigo press that creates out really nice work. 

Here is an example of the mix of digital and letterpress. Most of the color is printed by indigo so it’s not shiny like laser, and the black is letterpress. There is the deboss on the digital layer so you can feel it.

One challenging part mixing with digital is that it is always gonna wobble a little bit, while letterpress will never move. Our registration is really good. 

Me working here so long is that I now design stuff that will hopefully be easy to print, even though it looks complicated. We're not doing anything revolutionary, but our trademark is simple and elegant–is what Dan likes to say. So we always try to design things in such a way where they'll print well.

Every job is a challenge, which is good. It makes everything exciting, but the finances can be hard to work with as things have gone more digital. People just don't wanna wait for anything. They need everything like tomorrow and our lead time's about three weeks.

## About the future
### Word of Mouth
#### How do DWRI promote itself? How do the press make sure the machine keeps running?

 So right now we don't do any advertising. We are just word of mouth and we're busy. We've been trying to think about advertising forever, but it's just hard. We don't even send a newsletter.

We do Instagram occasionally but  it is kind of all over the place because Dan runs it. That's something we could start to think about advertising, because we can start to shift our client base. For instance, we do a lot of printing for colleges. We would like to do more printing for colleges because Williams College, for instance, sends out a really nice acceptance letter to its new students, which is so nice. Nothing too crazy, two or three colors, letterpress printed, and you can imagine how students are going to be excited when they open the package.

### If things are coming to an End?
#### Do you think one day letterpress is going to be obsolete? What do you think the future print is going to be when there is so much anxiety of rapidly developing technology like AI.


I'm not worried that letterpress printing is gonna go away.

There's always gonna be, I think, a demand for invitations and stationery if you were a paper person. You wanna send a nice note card. You don't send a generic. I think those people are still gonna be around. I see people are rejecting more screen stuff now, and we might be able to see a swing back towards hand processes and print. 

In terms of the anxiety to the rapid changing technology and AI,  I think that's why some people do come to us as a resistance to that very homogenous approach to print.

Again, Canva makes everything look the same, and AI is doing similar things. For us, because we are a slower process, and you get to talk to a real person.That's really appealing to folks. We are pretty concierge in terms of the services. You could come in and one of us will spend an hour with you talking over your project. We'll send you samples for free or a small amount of money, which you don't really get at a lot of other shops.

We've talked about that in the past, but for us it's way more beneficial for clients to look at all the sample books and find out things they really like about or don't like about. I want them to look and feel the surface of the sheet, and that make every communication to the end process smoothly.

We're not too worried about the new tech, partly because as we look around the shop, there's nothing that can really be replaced.  We can capture really small types, we can capture really small details. It's gonna be just their perfect color. You can customize it as much as you want. It's just not the same.

I will say too, it's interesting now that people have more access to design through that AI model.
